# Experiment 1: Array Operations

## Aim
To implement various operations on an array such as traversal, insertion, deletion, searching, updating, sorting, and merging.

---

## Theory
An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. It allows fast access using index values and is one of the most basic data structures in programming.

---

## Operations Performed

1. Traversal of array  
2. Insertion of element  
3. Deletion of element  
4. Searching an element  
5. Updating an element  
6. Sorting the array (Bubble Sort)  
7. Merging two arrays  

---

## Algorithm

1. Initialize the array with elements.  
2. Display elements using traversal.  
3. Insert a new element at the end of the array.  
4. Delete an element from the given index.  
5. Search for a given element.  
6. Update element at the given index.  
7. Sort the array using bubble sort.  
8. Merge two arrays into a third array.  

---

## Output
The program displays the array after each operation including insertion, deletion, searching, updating, sorting, and merging.

---

## Conclusion
Thus, various array operations were successfully implemented using C++. This experiment helps in understanding basic array manipulation techniques and strengthens the foundation of Data Structures.

## Language Used
C++
