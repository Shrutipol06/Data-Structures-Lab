# Experiment 2: Matrix Operations

## Aim
To implement various operations on matrices such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose.

---

## Theory
A matrix is a two-dimensional array arranged in rows and columns. Matrix operations are widely used in scientific computing, graphics, and data processing.

---

## Operations Performed

1. Matrix addition  
2. Matrix subtraction  
3. Matrix multiplication  
4. Transpose of matrix  

---

## Algorithm

1. Accept elements of two matrices.  
2. Display both matrices.  
3. Perform addition of matrices.  
4. Perform subtraction of matrices.  
5. Perform multiplication of matrices.  
6. Find transpose of a matrix.  

---

## Output
The program displays the result of matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose.

---

## Conclusion
Thus, matrix operations were successfully implemented using C++. This experiment helps in understanding two-dimensional arrays and matrix manipulation techniques.
